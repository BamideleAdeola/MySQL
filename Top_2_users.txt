#QUESTION : 
 /*  What are the top 2 States where our users come from? */

As a data analyst, you will definitely come across #SQL interview questions. 
Do note that your query is dependent on your database schema. 
At times, you are giving just one big table and most times it is in a snowflake schema. 
Also, the interviewer has mentioned that MySQL should be used for the above challenge. 
There were 3 tables so your knowledge of joins would come to play here. 
I have attached the Database Schema I got myself from MySQL Workbench. I will write on how you can get your Database schema (EER Diagram) in another post.
SQL server would have just giving me the opportunity to use TOP 2 function, but that is not the case in MySQL. 
Try to be familiar with the syntax of the different variant.

SELECT 
	u.state, COUNT(l.user_id) AS freq
FROM logs l
  JOIN users u 
  ON l.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.state
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 2;

Feel free to drop other ways of solving same challenge. How would you have solve this?
