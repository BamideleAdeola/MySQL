#QUESTION : 
 /* Which of our users have not placed any orders? */

The second question asked back then during one of my SQL interview questions was to determine which users have not placed any order. 
Still having a schema with 3 tables and it must be on MySQL Workbench.
I had to add a select statement in a WHERE CLAUSE connecting the two statement and tables with user id by NOT IN Clause. 

SELECT 
    u.id
FROM users u
WHERE u.id NOT IN (SELECT 
            user_id
        FROM
            orders);

Definitely you can solve this with JOIN and other queries. How would you have solved this?
Trust you find this useful.
